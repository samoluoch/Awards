This is an awwwards clone application that allows users to sign up, post projects, get ratings and comments on the projects that they post, search for projects, see projects of other users on the home page, and update their profile details.

### Developed By

### Description
In the app, users have to sign up for accounts before starting to post projects. After the users register, they can then login and start posting their projects through their profiles. They can also search for other users' projects using projects' titles. Once a user sees a project that they would like to rate, they click on the link to the website and are redirected to the website. They can then come back to the project and rate it on a scale of 1-10 based on usability, design, and content. The values of each are then displayed on the project based on the average score. Users also leave comment on these projects as they rate to justify their ratings. For a user to rate any project, they must be registered and logged in. However, viewing the projects do not require a user to be logged in.
